<span style="color:red; font-size: 125%">**Looking for Ph.D. position Fall 2024!!**</span>

I am a Master's student (M.S.E. in Data Science and Computer Science) at [Johns Hopkins University](https://www.jhu.edu/)(JHU). Prior to that, I received my Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science at South China University of Technology, advised by Prof. [Ying Gao](https://www.scholat.com/gaoying26.en).

I am currently a research assistant at [Computational Cognition, Vision, and Learning (CCVL) research group](https://ccvl.jhu.edu/), advised by Prof. [Alan Yuille](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~ayuille/) at JHU. I also work closely with [Prof. Haohan Wang](https://haohanwang.github.io/) from [UIUC](https://illinois.edu/) at [DREAM Lab](https://dreamlabuiuc.github.io/). Prior to that, I spent one wonderful year of internship as a researcher in [SenseTime Research](https://www.sensetime.com/) and two months at [Webank](https://www.webank.com/) as a Machine Learning Engineer.

My research interest lies in sample efficient, trustworthy and generalizable Machine Learning. I am also interested in Computer Vision, intrigued by various aspects such as scene understanding, 3D vision models and cogsci-inspired vision. I am currently fascinated by the following research questions:
- Can we use language to scaffold vision learning? The robust vision system humans possess can be partially credited to the human language which
inherently captures high-level semantics and abstractions facilitating easy compositional reasoning.
- How to better leverage 3D aware vision model to reason more robustly. Despite most vision models relying on 2D-pixel input, the world is intrinsically 3D. Beyond the sophisticated 3-D sensors, akin to human binocular vision, the critical aspect lies in developing a 3D aware structure behind the vision system that can model the real 3D world. 

I am also broadly interested in robust decision-making, LLM as agents and AI4SCI [^2].
