# JARVIS-Xs

JARVIS-Xs is an elite research team dedicated to advancing AI Agent technology, committed to pushing the frontiers of artificial intelligence.

## Our Vision

To continuously advance Agent technology frontiers, explore the next-generation CodeAgent paradigm, and conduct research that generates significant academic and industrial impact.

## Team Size

Our team currently consists of approximately 20 members, including:
- Professors and associate professors from China's top 985/211 universities
- Postdocs, PhDs, and master's students from prestigious international institutions (CMU, OSU, UTHealth Houston, HKUST, etc.)
- PhD/master's students from China's leading universities (Tsinghua, Peking University, USTC, Zhejiang University, etc.)

## Research Directions

Our research focuses on three core areas:

1. **RL Scaling + Agentic Reasoning**: Breakthrough research in reinforcement learning scaling and intelligent agent reasoning, including CodeAgent and DeepResearch directions
2. **Self-Evolve / Self-Learning + Co-Learning**: Exploring intelligent agents' self-evolution and self-learning capabilities, as well as collaborative learning mechanisms
3. **Finance-Agent**: Developing financial intelligent agents for multi-source data search and analysis, achieving autonomous portfolio optimization
