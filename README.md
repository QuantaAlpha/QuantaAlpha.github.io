# QuantaAlpha

QuantaAlpha is an elite research team dedicated to advancing AI Agent technology, committed to pushing the frontiers of artificial intelligence.

## Our Vision

To explore the ‚Äúquanta‚Äù of intelligence and lead the ‚Äúalpha‚Äù frontiers of AI Agents ‚Äî advancing CodeAgents, self-evolving intelligence, and domain-specialized agents to redefine the boundaries of artificial intelligence research.

## Team Size

Our team currently consists of approximately 20 members, including:
- Professors and associate professors from China's top 985/211 universities
- Postdocs, PhDs, and master's students from prestigious international institutions (CMU, OSU, UTHealth Houston, HKUST, etc.)
- PhD/master's students from China's leading universities (Tsinghua, Peking University, USTC, Zhejiang University, etc.)

## Research Directions

Our research focuses on three core areas:

- üíª CodeAgent: End-to-end execution for real-world coding tasks, enabling agents to autonomously understand, modify, and run complex repositories.
- üìö DeepResearch: Multi-step reasoning agents for open-ended scientific and knowledge discovery, capable of synthesizing insights across domains.
- üß† Agentic Reasoning / Agentic RL: Scaling reinforcement learning with reasoning-centered agents, bridging decision-making, planning, and adaptive intelligence.
- üîÑ Self-Evolving & Co-Learning Agents that continuously improve through self-evolution and collaborative learning, enabling emergent collective intelligence.
